Project Topic

In this project we will implement a digital version of an existing board game called "Risk" by using Java. Risk is a world domination  based strategy game. 3-6 Players are representing world leaders and they lead their armies to war agains other players to conquer world by completing certain quests. The wars between players are determined by dices. 

We will implement this board game by using Java Programmming Language and IntelIJ and Netbeans as IDEs. We will use other programmes for video and sound editting, UI Design and databases but those topics are not discussed yet.

We will add save game feature to the game by using a databese. Combat dice animations and sound effects to create an ambiance for the  game. As game mechanics we want to limit the attack number because as we observed this feature in game cause a snowball effect. Player who gets a lead can easily conquer anywhere and this situation decreases the game pleasure of the other players.In game the quests are too straightforward like kill a certain amount of soldiers. We want to add more interactive quests like conquer Middle East and hold it 2 turns.
