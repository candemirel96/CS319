Project Topic :

  In this project we will implement a digital version of an existing board game called "Risk" by using Java. Risk is a strategy game based on world domination. 3-6 Players are representing world leaders and they lead their armies to war against other players to conquer world while completing certain quests. The result of the wars between players are determined by throwing dices. 

  We will implement this board game by using Java programming language on  IntelIJ and Netbeans. We will use other programs for video and sound editing, UI Design and databases but these topics are not discussed yet.

  We will add save game feature to the game by using a database. Combat dice animations and sound effects will be added to create an ambiance for the  game. As game mechanics we want to limit the attack number because as we observed that this feature causes a snowball effect in gameplay such as any player who gets a lead can easily conquer anywhere and this situation decreases the game pleasure of the other players. In this game, the quests are too straightforward like killing a certain number of soldiers, so we want to add more interactive quests like conquer Middle East and hold it for 2 turns.
